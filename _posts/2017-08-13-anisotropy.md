excerpt: "Apply geometric anisotropic Bayesian models to simulated and real point referenced spatial datasets."

Isotropic covariance functions are routinely adopted in specifying models for point referenced spatial data.  Implicit in such modeling is the assumption that spatial dependence is not directional.  Geometric anisotropic models offer a class of specifications which incorporate directional dependence.  They have received little attention in the literature because their associated parameters increase and become difficult to identify as we increase richness of the function. This research aims to: (i) illuminate when and how much such models for random effects in geostatistical settings improve predictive performance, (ii) explore recent computational advances to facilitate fitting such models, (iii) extend such modeling to multivariate spatial and spatio-temporal settings.
