My name is Angie Shen, and I am a Senior at Duke University majoring in Statistics. 

I became interested in Statistics in my freshman year because I was fascinated by how it derives insights from quantitative analysis and integrates mathematical theory, computing and narrative. Through different classes, research and special projects, I have been able to find my interest in two specific areas: applications in medicine and Bayesian Machine Learning methods. These topics will be the focus of my graduate school research, as I plan to apply for PhD programs in Biostatistics and Statistics. 

I was first exposed to applying statistical analysis to problems in health care during my summer internship at a mental health non-profit, Center for Health and Wellbeing, in Belfast, UK. I surveyed 85 of the caregiver clientele on their mental health needs and analyzed the relationship between hours of care provided, mental health symptoms and treatment outcome. I presented the study to Belfast Social Care Trust and was able to acquire an additional £16,000 to serve the caregivers clientele at the Center. I started to appreciate how quantitative analysis can reveal important insights about patient needs and optimal treatment methods, and as a result, improves the effectiveness and efficiency of health care provision. 

In the summer of sophomore year, I started working with Biostatistician Dr. Ben Goldstein and Statistician Dr. Beka Steorts on precision medicine: improving health care outcomes by optimally utilizing patient information to provide personalized health care. We are working with clinicians from the Duke Hospital who extracted data on patients’ vitals measurements recorded throughout their stay in inpatient care units to predict acute adverse deterioration such as heart attack and code blue for those patients. We are currently working on a paper to submit to Biometrics in May, after which I will keep exploring other advanced methods of building the dynamic risk prediction model. 

This research project has made me realize that statisticians can make a tremendous difference in health care outcomes, which I used to think is solely the expertise of doctors. Quantitative analysis of clinical data can unveil individual health dynamics and prevent acute patient deterioration, which significantly improves the effectiveness and efficiency of health care delivery. In August of last year, I gave a talk on my research at Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM) in Chicago, the largest gathering of statisticians held in North America. At JSM I also attended talks on precision medicine and learned about other advanced methods of analyzing longitudinal survival data such as joint modeling. In December, I presented a poster at the Women in Machine Learning Workshop at the Neural Information Processing Systems Conference (NIPS) in Barcelona, one of the key three Machine Learning conferences in the world. During the conference I went to a workshop on machine learning in health and met researchers who are working on similar problems. Going to conferences and talking to researchers have helped me grasp my research question in depth and inspired me to learn and consider a variety of different methods that I could use to improve my analysis. I also learned how to effectively communicate my research to different audiences and engage in scholarly discussions with researchers. 

Besides applications in health, I am also interested in Bayesian statistical methods and Machine Learning. Three of the classes I have taken so far focus on Bayesian modeling. In Spring semester of sophomore year, I did an independent study with Dr. Steorts on Bayesian nonparametric models and how they can be applied to clustering problems where the cluster sizes are very small, such as identifying duplicated records in record linkage applications. I am also starting an independent study with Statistician Dr. Alan Gelfand, one of the leading experts on Bayesian computing, on Bayesian modeling of spatial anisotropy, after taking a graduate level course with him on Spatial Statistics. I took a graduate level course Probabilistic Machine Learning which introduced me to the basic mathematical theories behind machine learning algorithms. At NIPS conference, I attended many talks and workshops on cutting-edge machine learning research. I have been able to apply machine learning algorithms to real world data though projects at DataFest and computing classes. I hope to further work on these areas in graduate school.
